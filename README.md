# Motivation

* I'm lazy.

# TL; DR

## Dependencies

* Properly setup Perforce CLI. You have to be able to login to P4 using its CLI.

## Scripts

### Daily tasks

* [`update-last-green.sh`](update-last-green.sh) - Adds/Updates the tag `last-green` to the Git commit associated with the Perforce Changelist number provided as argument. Updates the tag in the remote `origin`.

### Sharing changes Git->P4

* [`patch_for_p4.sh`](patch_for_p4.sh) - Given a Git revision range, generate a
	patch file and a list of files affected by the patch.
* [`p4_reconcile_files.sh`](p4_reconcile_files.sh) - Given a list of files, reconcile each
file in the list using `p4 reconcile`.

### Sharing changes P4->Git

* [`p4-desc.sh`](p4-desc.sh) - List files affected by the Perforce changelist with  number `p4cl`.

### Creating symlinks for scripts

* [`create_links.sh`](create-links.sh) - Creates symlinks at the specified location. I place them at `~/bin`, e.g., 

```bash
$ ./create_links.sh ~/bin
$ ls -la ~/bin
 green-up -> update-last-green.sh
 p4-desc -> p4-desc.sh
 p4-patch -> patch_for_p4.sh
 p4-recon -> p4_reconcile_files.sh
```

# Long description

So, I've been working with `git-p4` in order to submit to a Perforce depot while doing my daily work with Git.

As I learn move about this workflow I have written a few scripts that save me some typing for common operations during my daily workflow.

## My setup

* Clone this repo into my `~/bin` directory
* I create symbolic links (`ln -s` or use [`create_links.sh`](create_links.sh)) for each of the scripts but with shorter names so I won't have to type as much, did I mention I'm lazy?

## Use cases

### Getting the latest from P4 and tagging it

As part of my daily process I have to sync my Git repo with the latest changes submitted to the
Perforce depo and also keep a tag to the last successful build. It usually looks like this:

* Checkout the synchronization branch
* Synchronize with P4 depot
* Find the latest P4 changelist number that builds successfully
* Create/Update tag `last-green` in the commit corresponding to such changelist
* Update my remote (`origin`)

Using the script this becomes:

`$ ./update-last-green.sh 123123`

## Sharing changes P4->Git

Many times I'm pairing with someone but for some reason they need to share some changes with me but they don't use Git.
So after lecturing them I ask them to shelve their changes so I can get them and apply them to my Git repo.

Running `p4 describe` usually adds meta information that makes it hard to pipe its output to be processed by other commands like `rsync`, e.g.

```bash
	$ p4 describe <changelist>

	Change 123123 by user@domain on <timestamp>

		Changelist description...

	Jobs fixed ...

		Stuffs....

	Affected files ...

	... //path/to/depot/branch/path/to/file1.xml#3 edit
	... //path/to/depot/branch/path/to/file2.xml#3 edit
	... //path/to/depot/branch/path/to/file3.xml#3 edit

	Differences ...

       More stuffs...

```

So the script `p4-desc.sh` cleans up the output so that we can pipe it into `rsync` to bring those changes in to our Git repo, e.g.,

```bash
	$ ./p4-desc.sh <changelist> "... //path/to/depot/"
	./path/to/file1.xml
	./path/to/file2.xml
	./path/to/file3.xml
```

At the end the whole process using the script looks like this:

* Manually unshelve the wanted changes into a new changelist
  * this step is still manual but can be automated, see [p4 unshelve](http://www.perforce.com/perforce/r14.2/manuals/cmdref/p4_unshelve.html))
* Test overwrite (`rsync -avn`):
  * `$ ./p4-desc.sh <changelist> [<prefix>] | rsync -avn --files-from=- $P4_DEPO/ $GIT_REPO/`
* Overwrite (`rsync -av`):
  * `$ ./p4-desc.sh <changelist> [<prefix>] | rsync -av --files-from=- $P4_DEPO/ $GIT_REPO/`

**Caveats:** this probably won't work for files that have been removed, only in files added or modified.

## Share changes from Git to Perforce

The depot I work with is huge and for some reason when I try to submit using
`$ git p4 submit` it takes forever just to get to the step where
I edit my commit message.

In most cases I end up:
* creating a patch file for my changes
* applying that patch in the Perforce depot
* reconciling those files since P4 doesn't keep track of changes in the filesystem
* preparing the CL and submitting using the visual client (P4V).

Here's how you can do the same:

```bash
# Generate patch for revision range
$ ./patch_for_p4.sh <abc123>..<abc124>
Patch written to patch-123.diff
List of changes written to changes-123.txt

$ cd $P4_DEPOT
$ git apply $GIT_REPO/patch-123.diff
# Make Perforce aware of the changes to the files in the list
$ ./p4_reconcile.sh $GIT_REPO/changes-123.txt
```
